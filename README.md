# ShareOurStrength

As part of our Capstone Project for George Mason University, we parterned with a Non-Profit Organization, "Share Our Strength", to assist them in their Data needs. 

The problem statement? "Share Our Strength" needed a more efficient way to process the data that comes in to allow for quicker and more comprehensive analysis. A sustainable data pipeline.

This repository contains the Data Wranglers team code and processes on using state agency raw data and standardizing them to clean data, fighting childhood hunger in collaboration with the Share Our Strength campaign, "No Kid Hungry".

## Alexis

Alexis is the custom tool we built on Excel to simplify the data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. The user simply uploads the raw data files into the program, clicks one button, and done! The file will be cleaned up and up to standard. No cost, easy-to-use, and customizable. 

## Alteryx

Alteryx is a software platform designed for data blending, preparation, and advanced analytics. It is primarily used by data analysts, data scientists, and business analysts to streamline the process of collecting, cleaning, and transforming data from various sources into a format that is suitable for analysis and reporting.

Alteryx, like any software platform, comes with its own set of benefits and potential drawbacks. Here are some of the key advantages and disadvantages of using Alteryx:

### Benefits of Alteryx:

Ease of Use: Alteryx provides a user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface that makes it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise. This ease of use can accelerate data preparation and analysis tasks.

Data Integration: It excels at integrating data from diverse sources, making it easier to work with data from databases, spreadsheets, cloud services, and more.

Data Transformation: Alteryx offers powerful data transformation capabilities, allowing users to clean and reshape data efficiently, saving time and effort.

### Drawbacks of Alteryx:

Cost: Alteryx can be expensive, particularly for smaller businesses and individual users. Licensing costs and additional modules can add up.

Learning Curve: While Alteryx is known for its user-friendly interface, more complex data preparation and analytical tasks may still require a learning curve, especially for those who are new to data analytics.

Resource Intensive: Working with large datasets can be resource-intensive, and users may encounter performance issues on less powerful hardware.


## Conclusion

We wanted to offer "Share Our Strength" both options and left it to them to make a decision on what was best for their use case.
