# ShareOurStrength

As part of our Capstone Project for George Mason University, we parterned with a Non-Profit Organization, "Share Our Strength", to assist them in their Data needs. 

The problem statement? "Share Our Strength" needed a more efficient way to process the data that comes in to allow for quicker and more comprehensive analysis. A sustainable data pipeline.

This repository contains the Data Wranglers team code and processes on using state agency raw data and standardizing them to clean data, fighting childhood hunger in collaboration with the Share Our Strength campaign, "No Kid Hungry".
